# ALX Backend GraphQL CRM

A comprehensive Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system built with Django and GraphQL, developed as part of the ALX Backend Specialization program.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of GraphQL APIs in Django using industry-standard practices. It covers the fundamentals of GraphQL, its advantages over REST APIs, and practical implementation using graphene-django.

### Key Features

- **GraphQL API**: Single endpoint for all data operations
- **Django Integration**: Seamless integration with Django ORM
- **GraphiQL Interface**: Interactive API explorer for development
- **Modular Architecture**: Clean, scalable codebase structure
- **Industry Standards**: Follows best practices for version control and documentation

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By working with this project, you will learn to:

- Implement GraphQL APIs in Django applications
- Design clean and modular GraphQL schemas
- Write custom queries and mutations using graphene
- Integrate Django models into GraphQL schemas
- Optimize performance and security in GraphQL endpoints
- Use GraphiQL and other tools for API testing and development

## 🛠 Technology Stack

- **Backend Framework**: Django 4.2.7
- **GraphQL Implementation**: graphene-django 3.1.5
- **Database**: SQLite (development)
- **API Testing**: GraphiQL (included)
- **Development Environment**: VS Code (recommended)

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)
- Git
- VS Code (recommended) or your preferred IDE

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nissau96/alx-backend-graphql_crm.git
cd alx-backend-graphql_crm
```

### 2. Set Up Virtual Environment

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate

# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Configure the Database

```bash
# Apply database migrations
python manage.py migrate

# (Optional) Create a superuser for admin access
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

### 5. Run the Development Server

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

### 6. Access the Application

- **GraphiQL Interface**: http://localhost:8000/graphql/
- **Django Admin**: http://localhost:8000/admin/

## 🔍 API Usage

### Basic Query Example

Access the GraphiQL interface at `http://localhost:8000/graphql/` and try this query:

```graphql
{
  hello
}
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "data": {
    "hello": "Hello, GraphQL!"
  }
}
```

## 🔧 Development Workflow

### Git Workflow

This project follows conventional commit standards:

```bash
# Feature commits
git commit -m "feat: add new functionality"

# Bug fixes
git commit -m "fix: resolve issue with query resolution"

# Documentation updates
git commit -m "docs: update API documentation"

# Configuration changes
git commit -m "config: update Django settings"
```

### Code Quality Standards

- **PEP 8**: Python code style guide compliance
- **Type Hints**: Use type annotations where appropriate
- **Docstrings**: Comprehensive documentation for all functions and classes
- **Error Handling**: Proper exception handling and logging
- **Testing**: Unit tests for all GraphQL resolvers

## 📚 GraphQL Concepts

### Key Concepts Covered

- **Schema**: Defines the structure of your GraphQL API
- **Types**: Custom data types that represent your domain models
- **Queries**: Read operations to fetch data
- **Mutations**: Write operations to modify data
- **Resolvers**: Functions that fetch data for specific fields
- **GraphiQL**: Interactive development environment for GraphQL

### GraphQL vs REST

| Aspect | GraphQL | REST |
|--------|---------|------|
| Endpoints | Single endpoint | Multiple endpoints |
| Data Fetching | Request exactly what you need | Fixed data structure |
| Over-fetching | Eliminated | Common issue |
| Under-fetching | Eliminated | Requires multiple requests |
| Versioning | Schema evolution | URL versioning |

## 🔒 Security Considerations

- **Authentication**: Implement proper user authentication
- **Authorization**: Control access to sensitive data
- **Query Depth Limiting**: Prevent deeply nested queries
- **Rate Limiting**: Protect against abuse
- **Input Validation**: Validate all user inputs
- **Error Handling**: Don't expose sensitive information in errors

## 🚀 Deployment

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file for production settings:

```env
SECRET_KEY=your-production-secret-key
DEBUG=False
ALLOWED_HOSTS=your-domain.com
DATABASE_URL=your-database-connection-string
```

### Production Checklist

- [ ] Set `DEBUG = False`
- [ ] Configure production database
- [ ] Set up proper logging
- [ ] Configure static file serving
- [ ] Implement security headers
- [ ] Set up monitoring and error tracking

## 🧪 Testing

Run the test suite:

```bash
# Run all tests
python manage.py test

# Run specific app tests
python manage.py test crm

# Run with coverage
coverage run --source='.' manage.py test
coverage report
```

## 📖 API Documentation

The GraphQL schema is self-documenting. Access the GraphiQL interface at `/graphql/` to:

- Explore the schema
- View available queries and mutations
- Test API operations interactively
- Access built-in documentation
